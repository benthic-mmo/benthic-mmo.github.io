  <h1>Welcome to the Benthic docs!</h1>
  <h3>Benthic is a project with the goal of enabling developers to easily create fast and straightforward open metaverse
    applications.</h3>

  <p>
  <h1>What is Benthic?</h1>
  Benthic is a collection of tools built for accessing the open metaverse, a network of federated 3d virtual worlds
  running the open metaverse protocol.
  </h1>

  <p>These docs aim to be a resource for understanding high-level concepts that surround open metaverse projects. Things
    like handshake flows, rendering pipeline logic, and the assumptions existing metaverse servers make will be
    explained in high-level here, along with links to the rust crate docs containing specific implementation
    information.</p>

  <div class="bubble-row">
    <div class="bubble">
      <h2>Async</h2>
      <p>Benthic is entirely asyncronous, using the actix actor framework for message sending and receiving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="bubble">
      <h2>Open Standards</h2>
      <p>This project aims to be fully compatable with existing open metaverse standards, while working to
        streamline
        the adoption of more modern ones.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bubble">
      <h2>Extensible</h2>
      <p>Benthic's goal is for any component to be usable by any project, in any language. Messages are sent between
        components using open formats, allowing your project to implement only what it needs. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="bubble">
      <h2>Modular</h2>
      <p>Using rust's feature capabilties, you can compile only the parts of the project you need.</p>

  <h1>Project Goals</h1>
<div class="center">
    <div class="bubble-column" style="max-width: 1000px">
      <div class="bubble contrast small">
        <h2>Documentaton</h2>
        <p>
          This project aims to be fully documented, and developer friendly. These docs, along with the rust crate's docs 
          should be able to function as a complete spec for the protocol, enabling other projects to implement 
          open metaverse functionality into their own projects.
          <br>
          <br>
          If given a choice between implicit functionality and verbosity, always favor verbosity. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble contrast small">
        <h2>Modularity</h2>
        <p>
          Each part of this project should be useful on its own to other projects. Viwer core, UI, server, mesh generation,
          and message handling should all exist entirely seperately from each other. External-facing parts of the project
          should use language-agnostic interfaces, like JSON or UDP packets.
          <br>
          <br>
          If given a choice between monolithic and modular, always choose modular.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble contrast small">
        <h2>Community</h2>
        <p>
          People write code for other people. The community surrounding this project aims to be 
          deliberate, welcoming, and curious. 
          <br>
          <br>
          If given a choice between welcoming new contributors and developer efficiency, always choose the new contributors. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble contrast small">
        <h2>Standardization</h2>
        <p>
          Whenever possible, this project should prioritize well-documented and standardized tools and frameworks. 
          <br>
          <br>
          If given the choice between purpose-built and common standards, always choose common standards. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bubble contrast small">
        <h2>Testability</h2>
        <p>
          All code should prioritize being written in a way that is machine-testable, both through unit testing and end to end testing.
          <br>
          <br>
          If given the choice between testable code and efficient code, prioritize testability.

  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p>
  <h3>The benthic project stretches across several repos, containing several different crates. There are four primary
    crates that contain the majority of the project's code.</h3>
  <div class="bubble-row">
    <div class="bubble contrast">
      <a href="https://github.com/benthic-mmo/metaverse_client">
        <h1>Metaverse Client</h1>
      </a>
      The base rust crate which contains the core functionality and structs for metaverse clients. This contains
      functionality for packet parsing, capability handling, and inventory management, along with the metaverse_messages
      crate, which contain rust
      structs for server data.
    </div>
    <div class="bubble contrast">
      <a href="https://github.com/benthic-mmo/benthic_viewer">
        <h1>Benthic Viewer</h1>
      </a>
      A simple godot frontend for the metaverse client project. This can be used as a reference for creating other
      viewer projects that implement the core.
    </div>
    <div class="bubble contrast">
      <a href="https://github.com/benthic-mmo/metaverse_gltf">
        <h1>Metaverse Mesh</h1>
      </a>
      mesh file generation for client and server projects. Converts JSON files of mesh data into usable file formats which can be used
      by servers to create 3d file serving endpoints, or clients to easily render objects using common 3d file formats.
    </div>
    <div class="bubble contrast">
      <a href="https://github.com/benthic-mmo/serde-llsd">
        <h1>Serde LLSD</h1>
      </a> A fork of John Nagle's <a href="https://github.com/John-Nagle/serde-llsd">serde-llsd</a>, containing extra serializing and deserializing functions that include non-documented protocols, and somewhat niche types used by the project like XMLRPC. 
    </div>
  </div>
  <br>
  The recommended project layout for developing looks like this:
  <pre><code>
benthic_project/
  ├── metaverse_client/
  ├── metaverse_gltf/
  ├── benthic_viewer/
  └── serde-llsd/

OpenSimulator
  └── bin/
    </code></pre>

  In order to test the project live, an instance of OpenSimulator must be running. Download the software <a
    class="contrast_link" href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Download">
    here
  </a> and run locally, or connect to an existing server using your username and password for that grid.
  <br>
  

  {% capture Warn %}
  <h2>Local Testing</h2>
  Due to the way the opensim server capability endpoint urls work, you must be connected to a wifi network to test, even when running both server and client locally.  
  {% endcapture %}

  {% include evil_benthic.html content=Warn %}

  <br>
  The majority of the business logic lives in metaverse_client, and will be "home base" when developing.
  Each crate within metaverse_client has its own depenencies, and can be built and tested independently from each other.
  When building and testing locally, make sure that your local dependencies are specified in the Cargo.yaml, and not the
  release version.


  <pre><code class="language-rust">
[dependencies]
  metaverse_messages = {path = "../messages/"}
  metaverse_environment = {path = "../environment/"}
  metaverse_agent = {path = "../agent/"}
  metaverse_inventory = {path = "../inventory/"}
  metaverse_gltf = {path = "../../../metaverse_mesh/"}
  benthic-serde-llsd = {path = "../../../serde-llsd/"}
  // more dependencies ...
    </code></pre>
  Metaverse_client contains a debug UI, and can be run as a standalone project using
  <pre><code>cargo run</code></pre>
  <br>
  Benthic creates a directory at <code>~/.local/share/benthic/</code>, which will be used by the project to store
  generated files. It is a useful directory to check when debugging.
